Project Overview

This project highlights my work in end-to-end manual and automation testing of the Bewakoof application. Using Selenium with the POM approach and the Cucumber framework, I automated key functionalities to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and reliability. Additionally, I prepared comprehensive manual testing documentation and provided actionable suggestions to improve the applicationâ€™s functionality and user experience.

Key Contributions


Automation Testing

Performed end-to-end automation testing using Selenium with the POM design pattern and Cucumber framework.
Designed and executed test scenarios covering functional, UI, and regression testing.
Utilized Selenium assertions, such as:
assertEquals: Validated expected vs. actual results.
assertTrue/assertFalse: Verified conditions for various test cases.
assertNotNull: Ensured critical elements are present in the DOM.
Generated detailed test execution reports and feature files for each test cycle using Cucumber.


Manual Testing


Created and executed the following testing documents:

Test Plan: Defined objectives, scope, and approach.
Test Scenarios and Test Cases: Ensured maximum coverage of application workflows.
Traceability Matrix (RTM): Mapped requirements to test cases for validation.
Bug Reports: Documented issues with steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.
Execution Summary: Provided a concise overview of testing results.
